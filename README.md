# Tools used for this project was:

- Excel
- Tableau Public


# Overview of project:

So I downloaded the dataset from a site called Data World as a .xlsx file.

I opened the .xlsx file in Microsoft Excel.

Made sure to visually clean the dataset using find and replace for blanks and typo errors.
Spacing out columns containing the rows, to look more presentable once I connect it to Tableau. 


Inside Tableau I connected my to my excel file 'Personal Consumption Expenditures'.
The connection was successful. 

I wanted the dashboard to show the data of the overall expenses through the years in the USA, 
but first I needed to create sheets for the components carrying the data in which, I wanted to present on the dahsboard. 

Started off making sheets for top food groups that had the most expenses in the year 2020. Also showing food groups individual expenses by year.

Once I was done creating my sheets of individual components, dragged the sheets one-by-one onto my dashbaord.

Sheet Components used in dashboard:

- Area Chart
- Line Chart
- Pie Chart
- Vertical Bar Chart
- Bubble CHart
- Standard table
- Along with Caption boxes


Afterwards I even created story tabs showing explaining each component use on the dashbaord including all-time high,
the rise in food groups, top 5 foods and ovearall total expenses in 2020. 
This is useful for explaining purposes to give a little walkthrough about the dashboard being presented. 

I also included using and modifiying click function animations on certain components within the dashboard to use as a sort of drill down filter.
